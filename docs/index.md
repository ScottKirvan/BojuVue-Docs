  name: "BojuVue"
  text: "Shared Vue 3 components"
  tagline: A component library published to npm, for any Vue 3 app — with VitePress-aware builds available where they help. Install it, register the components you need, and update later with npm update.
# Action buttons manually disables in favor of BojuVue buttons

features:
  - icon: 🔀
    title: Two builds, one import surface
    details: Every component is exported from bojuvue. Components with VitePress-specific needs ship a second, fully independent implementation under the same name at bojuvue/vitepress — the import path is what disambiguates them.

  - icon: 📦
    title: vitepress is optional
    details: Installing the package alone never pulls in vitepress. Only importing from the /vitepress subpath does — the generic build has zero vitepress in its module graph.

  - icon: 🔗
    title: vue is a peer dependency
    details: A consuming site uses its own Vue instance — no duplicate copy of Vue in the bundle, no broken reactivity across component boundaries.
