# BVMoreButton

A button that opens a dropdown menu of secondary outbound links: GitHub repo, report a
bug, request a feature, and the like. It sits next to a primary call to action without
giving those secondary links equal visual weight. Modeled on the pattern used by
Obsidian's community-plugin pages.

By default the button shows visible text reading "More..." (auto-width, same
padding/sizing as `BVPlatformButton`). Pass your own `text` to change the label, or an
empty string (`text=""`) to switch to the icon-only mode instead — three dots (⋯) at a
small fixed size, no visible text; see [Props](#props) below.

`BVMoreButton` renders its trigger through [`BVIconButton`](./icon-button) internally
rather than owning its own button markup/CSS — its own logic (the menu panel, keyboard
handling, placement algorithm) is unchanged either way, but on the `/vitepress` import
path, that means text mode (any non-empty `text`) now renders through VitePress's real
`VPButton` and gets its theme styling automatically, same as `BVPlatformButton`.
Icon-only mode (`text=""`) still renders through a hand-rolled button on both paths —
`VPButton` has no concept of a fixed-size icon-only shape.

Two independent implementations, same as [`BVPlatformButton`](./platform-button).
Import it from either path; the `/vitepress` path gets real `VPButton` styling for
free, so prefer it inside a VitePress site:

```ts
import { BVMoreButton } from 'bojuvue'
// or, inside a VitePress site, for real VPButton styling in text mode:
import { BVMoreButton } from 'bojuvue/vitepress'
```

::: warning Dropdown panel looks unstyled? You're missing the stylesheet import
`BVMoreButton`'s trigger renders through the real `VPButton` (or a hand-rolled
equivalent), so it can look basically fine even without BojuVue's own CSS loaded — but
the dropdown panel itself (background, border, shadow, item spacing, icon sizing) is
all BojuVue-authored, not VitePress's. If it opens as plain unstyled links instead of a
floating card, you're missing:

```ts
import 'bojuvue/style.css'
```

See [Import the stylesheet](/guide/installation#import-the-stylesheet) — this is the
one setup step it's easiest to skip, since everything else about a component can look
fine without it right up until you open this menu.

The first button above is the default — visible text reading "More...". The second is
the same component with `text=""`, switching to the icon-only three-dot mode instead.

Try it with a keyboard: focus one of the buttons above and press `ArrowDown` (jumps to
the first item) or `ArrowUp` (jumps to the last item), then `ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp` to
move between items (wrapping at both ends), `Home`/`End` to jump to the first/last
item, and `Escape` to close and return focus to the button.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `items` | `BVMoreButtonItem[]` | *(required)* | The menu's contents, in order. See below for the item shape. |
| `text` | `string` | `'More...'` | Visible button text. Pass an empty string (`text=""`) to switch to icon-only mode instead (fixed-size button, no visible text). With any non-empty text, the button is an auto-width pill layout, showing `icon` (if also given) next to it. |
| `icon` | `string` | *(none)* | Raw SVG markup rendered via `v-html`. In icon-only mode (`text=""`), replaces the built-in three-dot icon. With text, only rendered if you explicitly set this — otherwise the button shows text alone, no icon. Rendered unescaped — caller-supplied only, never fed anything dynamic/untrusted; see the warning below. |
| `label` | `string` | `'More options'` | Sets the button's `aria-label`. Only applied in icon-only mode (`text=""`) — with visible text, the accessible name comes from that text content instead, so this prop is ignored rather than layered on top. |
| `size` | `'medium' \| 'big'` | `'medium'` | Sets the button's dimensions: `'medium'` is a 38px fixed size (icon-only) or a 38px-tall pill (with text); `'big'` is 46px either way. |
| `theme` | `'brand' \| 'alt' \| 'sponsor'` | `'brand'` | Sets the button's color scheme via a modifier class: `'brand'` is a solid accent color, `'alt'` is neutral/muted, `'sponsor'` is a pink accent. See [Styling](#styling) below for where these colors come from. |

`BVMoreButtonItem`:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `label` | `string` | *(required)* | The menu item's visible text. |
| `href` | `string` | *(required)* | The link target. Rendered as a real `<a role="menuitem">`, so Enter-to-activate and middle-click/ctrl-click-to-open-in-new-tab work natively with no extra code. |
| `icon` | `string` | *(none)* | Raw SVG markup rendered via `v-html` next to the label. Caller-authored only — the `items` array is something you write yourself, never unescaped user input. |
| `target` | `string` | *(none)* | Left unset by default so a smart default applies: `target="_blank"` when `href` looks external. Set it explicitly only to override that. |
| `rel` | `string` | *(none)* | Left unset by default so a smart default applies: `rel="noreferrer"` when `href` looks external. Set it explicitly only to override that. |

::: warning `icon` is rendered unescaped
Both the button's `icon` and each item's `icon` go through `v-html` with no
sanitization. `items` is something you write yourself, not fetched or user-supplied,
so this is safe as long as it stays that way. Never wire `items` up to anything
dynamic without escaping it first.
:::

It renders as a real `<button>` element (not an `<a>`) since it has no `href` of its
own — it only ever toggles the menu.

## Styling

On the bare `bojuvue` import, the button (via `BVIconButton`/`BVButton`)
reads the same public `--vp-button-*` CSS custom properties VitePress itself exposes
for theming, each with a fallback value so it still looks like a clickable button
outside a VitePress site (where those variables are undefined) — the same tokens
`BVPlatformButton`'s generic build also reads. On the `/vitepress` import, text mode
renders through VitePress's real `VPButton` instead (no fallback values needed — this
build only ever runs inside a real VitePress site), while icon-only mode still reads
those same custom properties directly. The dropdown panel reads VitePress's public
`--vp-c-*` design tokens for its background, border, and text color — with fallback
values on the bare import, without them on `/vitepress`.

## Keyboard behavior

Following the WAI-ARIA menu button pattern:

- **Enter/Space on the button** toggles the menu open/closed — native `<button>`
  behavior, no custom handling needed.
- **`ArrowDown` on the button while the menu is closed** opens it and moves focus to
  the *first* item. **`ArrowUp`** in the same state opens it and moves focus to the
  *last* item — lets a keyboard user jump straight to the last option without arrowing
  through everything.
- **While the menu is open**, `ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp` move real DOM focus between items,
  wrapping at both ends. `Home`/`End` jump to the first/last item.
- **`Escape`** closes the menu from anywhere inside it and returns focus to the
  button.
- **Clicking outside** the component closes the menu, with no focus change.
- **Enter on a focused item** navigates natively — it's a real anchor with real DOM
  focus, so nothing is intercepted.

Deliberately not handled: no auto-close on window blur/tab switch, and no special
handling when a menu item is activated. Ordinary browser navigation already does the
right thing for an outbound link, so there's nothing extra to add there.

## Placement

The panel's preferred alignment is **leading-edge** — its left edge flush with the
button's left edge, opening below and to the right. It's still clamped to stay on
screen at any viewport width, computed at open time and recomputed on window resize
*and scroll* while open (the panel is `position: fixed` in viewport coordinates, so
without recomputing on scroll it would stay put while the button scrolled away
underneath it) via a three-step algorithm:

1. Try leading-edge — the panel's left edge flush with the button's left edge. Use it
   if it doesn't clip past the right edge of the viewport.
2. Otherwise flip to trailing-edge — the panel's right edge flush with the button's
   right edge — which kicks in when the button sits close to the right edge of the
   viewport. Use it if it doesn't clip past the left edge.
3. Otherwise (the viewport is narrower than the panel) clamp the panel inside the
   viewport as a last resort.

## Spacing

Like `BVPlatformButton`, `BVMoreButton` claims no margin on itself — spacing between it
and a neighboring primary CTA is a caller/layout concern. Use a flex container with
`gap`, the way the demo above is wrapped.

## Explicitly out of scope

- **No VitePress-aware convenience.** `items` is always a plain prop you pass in
  explicitly — this component never reads `useData().themeConfig.socialLinks` or
  anything else VitePress-specific for you. You always know exactly what's in the
  menu, because you're the one who put it there.
- **No nested/submenu items.** Every item is a flat, single-level link.
- **No manifest/remote-fetched items.** `items` is always something the caller already
  has in hand — no async state, no loading state to design for.

## Usage

`BVMoreButton` works the same from either import path — this example uses the bare
package, so it's just as valid in a non-VitePress Vue 3 app:

```vue
<script setup>
import { BVMoreButton, BVPlatformButton } from 'bojuvue'
</script>

<template>
  <div style="display: flex; gap: 12px; align-items: center;">
    <BVPlatformButton fallback-href="https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/releases" />

    <BVMoreButton
      :items="[
        {
          label: 'GitHub repo',
          href: 'https://github.com/your-org/your-repo',
          icon: "<svg viewBox='0 0 24 24' width='16' height='16'>...</svg>",
        },
        { label: 'Report a bug', href: 'https://github.com/your-org/your-repo/issues/new' },
      ]"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

Icon-only mode, with a custom icon, label, theme, and size:

```vue
<BVMoreButton
  text=""
  label="Plugin options"
  theme="alt"
  size="big"
  icon="<svg viewBox='0 0 24 24' width='16' height='16'><path d='M12 2 2 22h20z'/></svg>"
  :items="items"
/>
```

Overriding the default "More..." text:

```vue
<BVMoreButton text="More options" :items="items" />
```
